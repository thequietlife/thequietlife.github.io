<h2>About Me</h2
<p>Hey, I am M. Miller-Furesh aka thequietlife. I worked with a great Cybersecurity specialist, let’s call him Paul, who kindled my interest in 
 cybersecurity. When I was asking him about he would need to do for our new intranet, he said a pen test. I asked him what that was. He explained patiently. It’s peeps like this that makes our community awesome. 
 I read everything he handed out to the teams and that led me to seeing Kevin Mitnick when he was in town. 
  I realised I needed to learn technical skills. Then Covid hit, but I discovered <a href="https://au.comfycon.rocks/">ComfyCon Au</a> 
  A awesome discord community of super friendly,funny, knowledgable and helpful peeps. I now I have been in cybersecurity for 1 year and its been pretty awesome.

TL;DR
Project Portfolio Analysis > Software Tester @ <a href="https://www.cydarm.com/"> Cydarm, a SOC case management platform > QA Manager @ <a href="https://www.cydarm.com/"> Cydarm
