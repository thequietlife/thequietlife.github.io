<p>Hey, I am M. Miller-Furesh aka thequietlife. I have moved from publishing to management and project portfolio management. I liked the analysis side of project portfolio analysis but wanted to challenge myself and learn new technical skills. I was introduced to cybersecurity and realised I wanted to learn more. I have started a blog to document my journey learning security research, one bug at a time. With my pup by my side.</p>
