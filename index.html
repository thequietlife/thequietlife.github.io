<h1>Field Notes: Learning security research</h1>

<h2>About Me</h2>
  
<p>TL;DR</p>
<p>Project Portfolio Management &#8594; Software Tester, <a href="https://www.cydarm.com/"> Cydarm</a> &#8594; QA Manager, <a href="https://www.cydarm.com/">Cydarm</a> </p>
<p>Hey, I am M. Miller-Furesh aka thequietlife. Over the years I moved from publishing to management and then project portfolio management. I hit a point a couple of years ago where it was time to reset my career. I didn’t want to be in the ’non-technical’ group. I wanted to build deep expertise in one technical area. I have coded on and off - as an editor at LexisNexis, designing and building landing pages to test startup ideas. When I was younger I loved tinkering with innards of machines, pulling them apart and doing creative stuff like making paper mache masks. But over the years I stopped doing creative things like drawing, I kept reading as an outlet but not really creating. I quit social media for about two years and that helped me focus. Now I push myself to create rather than just consume. 
I worked with a great peep who was really passionate about promoting cybersecurity awareness and best practices. He organised workshops on topics like phishing, provided information sheets on cybersecurity basics and made himself available to talk about cyber issues. That’s how I got started on my journey in cybersecurity. I have started a blog to document my journey.</p>
