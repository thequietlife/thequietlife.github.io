<h1>Field Notes: Learning security research</h1>
<br>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p style="font-family:verdana";> Hey, I am M. Miller-Furesh aka thequietlife. I worked with a great Cybersecurity specialist, let’s call him Paul, who kindled my interest in 
 cybersecurity. When I asked him what he would need to do for our new intranet, he said a pen test. I asked him what that was. He explained patiently. It’s peeps like this that makes our community awesome. 
 I read everything he handed out to the teams and that led me to see Kevin Mitnick when he was in town. 
  I realised I then needed to learn technical cyber skills. Then Covid hit, but I discovered <a href="https://au.comfycon.rocks/">ComfyCon Au</a> 
  An awesome online conference and discord community of super friendly, funny, knowledgable and helpful peeps. I have been in cybersecurity for one year and it's been pretty amazing.
