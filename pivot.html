The last year or two have been super weird with Covid. What was good was having time to stop and reflect. To figure out what I needed to change about my career.

I moved to Sydney and started in publishing as an editor. Coding was part of the role. A vacancy come up for a team leader. I thought hey I can do this. 

I stayed in publishing management for a few years. At times it was great I learnt new technical and soft skills and worked on some cool projects - new products and a secondment to New Delhi.

But it was at a cost. It took a lot out of me pushing myself out of my comfort zone and managing people. It didn’t help that I had to help the team through restructures - really ugly restructures. 

Fast forward a few years and I moved back to my hometown. I thought moving into project management would continue my career trajectory even though I knew I didn’t want to manage people or teams. 

I did project management for a few years, moved into project portfolio management. I met some amazing people and worked on some interesting stuff. 

I volunteered to run a coding club at a local school. It was amazing creating a forum for girls to learn to code and make games. Some of the stuff they made was very cool. 

I was also doing experiments with startup ideas.  

I did freeCodeCamp web design course, heaps of tutorials on HTML and CSS. But I quickly would forget the details. So I took Pieter Levels advice and starting coding a website one step at a time. Google how to add a title in HTML, code that and then google the next thing. It was rewarding designing, coding and doing experiments to see if I could grow an idea. It was a mixed bag of experiments, a coffee pop up at a local barbershop, a couple of project management tools, sneaker cleaning as well as freelancing for startups. It was a bumpy time.

I then got a gig that introduced me to cybersecurity. There was a Cybersecurity specialist, let’s call him Paul. When I asked him what he would need to do for our new intranet, he said a pen test. I asked him what that was. No attitude he just explained patiently like a champ. I read everything he handed out and went to all the workshops on secure passwords, phishing, social engineering. He really wanted to raise awareness of cybersecurity. And I just gobbled it all up. (Insert nerd emoji) It’s peeps like this that makes the cybersecurity info sec community awesome. Then I saw Kevin Mitnick when he was in town.  I realised I needed to learn technical cyber skills. It was time to reset, to become a subject matter expert and get deep experience in one area. 

Then Covid hit, but I discovered ComfyCon Au An awesome online conference and discord community of super friendly, funny, knowledgable and helpful peeps. 

I have been in cybersecurity for one year now and it's been pretty amazing. I work with an amazing team at Cydarm Technologies.</p>
